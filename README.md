[clisso](https://github.com/allcloud-io/clisso): Get temporary credentials for cloud providers from the command line for [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) version manager.

Originally done due to a brew version upgrade of clisso from 0.7.0 to 0.8.1 breaking due to some 500 error on OneLogin's side.
